Criteria are met when patients fulfil all the entry criteria which are: +Signs/symptoms of COVID-19, ±reverse transcriptase PCR(RT-PCR) positive for COVID-19 and +ground-glass opacity(GGO) by high-resolution CT(HRCT) (or chest X-ray) and at least one criterion per each cluster. Cut-off values were calculated using a genetic algorithm.">
