			purpose = <"To predict risk of cardiac arrest using ward vital signs.">
			use = <"To identify patients' risk for suffering adverse events on the wards based on routinely measured paramaters at ward, which are:
- respiratory rate (breaths/minute)
- heart rate (beats/minute)
- diastolic blood pressure (mmHg)
- age (years)

Every measured paramater will represent a certain score which will be calculated into a total CART score. A patient with the CART score of more than 20 is interpreted as high risk of having an event of cardiac arrest, while a score of 20 or lower means low risk of such event.">
